The script in this folder aims at converting the data from the tless dataset into something that graspit can use.

## TODO

- Make the generate_ply script do only PLY generation. The script needs open3d. When installing it with pip, the version of pip that is installed is not compatible with the one that Pinocchio uses.
- Add a script to create a world with a tless object and a gripper. There are some functions in the generate_ply script.
